title: Studio Ghibli Catalog API

The Studio Ghibli Catalog API creates a condensed databse from this endpoint:
https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#tag/Films

Four endpoints were created in order to easy paginate and be promptly read through the frontend.

This databse focuses in bringing up to the user the **titles**, **banners**, **descriptions**, **directors** and **producers** of Studio Ghibli's productions.
